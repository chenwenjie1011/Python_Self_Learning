Self learning practice problems

Hi, I'm Wenjie.

I am currently learning python3 by myself. 

This repository contains some practice problems I did.

If you spot any mistakes, please correct me.

If you have suggestions or good resources for learing python, please leave a comment.

I appreciate your help. 

Thank you.
